It's Super Bowl Sunday — and AI stole the show. Here are today's top 10 tech stories.

## 1. 🏈 AI Takes Over the Super Bowl

Super Bowl LX became the unofficial **AI Bowl**. Both OpenAI and Anthropic ran competing ads — a first for AI companies at this scale.

- **OpenAI** pushed its Codex coding agent: *"You can just build things"*
- **Anthropic** countered with an anti-advertising stance for Claude: *"There is a time and place for ads. Your conversations with AI should not be one of them"*
- Sam Altman called Anthropic's original version "clearly dishonest"; the aired version was softened

The AI brand war has officially gone mainstream. At $7M+ per 30-second spot, these companies are betting big on consumer mindshare.

## 2. 🤥 Fake OpenAI Hardware "Leak" Goes Viral

A fabricated Reddit post claiming to show OpenAI's first hardware device — a shiny orb with earbuds, featuring actor Alexander Skarsgård — fooled thousands during the game. OpenAI's Greg Brockman called it "fake news." The account behind it was previously a Santa Monica bookkeeper.

AI hype is so intense that manufactured leaks now generate massive engagement. Social media remains vulnerable to AI-adjacent misinformation.

## 3. 💰 $670 Billion: AI Spending to Exceed the Moon Landing

Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet plan a combined **$670 billion** in AI infrastructure spending in 2026. As a percentage of GDP, this exceeds nearly every major capital effort in US history — surpassed only by the 1803 Louisiana Purchase.

The scale is staggering and will define compute availability, energy demand, and the data center landscape for the next decade.

## 4. 🇪🇺 EU Orders Meta: Open WhatsApp to Other AIs

The European Commission ruled that Meta's November decision to block ChatGPT, Copilot, and other AI assistants from WhatsApp violates EU antitrust law. The EC labeled the situation "urgent" due to potential "irreparable" damage to AI competition.

This sets a major precedent for platform interoperability. If upheld, it could reshape how AI agents integrate with messaging platforms globally.

## 5. 📜 New York Proposes AI Labeling + Data Center Moratorium

Two bills under consideration in the NY legislature:

- **NY FAIR News Act**: Mandates disclaimers on AI-generated news, human editorial review, and transparency about AI use in newsrooms
- **S9144**: A 3-year moratorium on new data center permits, citing tripled large-load power requests (10+ GW expected over 5 years)

Data center moratoriums could become the next major bottleneck for AI infrastructure. The news labeling bill may set templates for other states.

## 6. 🌐 AI.com Launches at Super Bowl

Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek unveiled **AI.com** during a Super Bowl spot, teasing AI agent handles for figures like "Mark," "Sam," and "Elon." The platform claims it will mainstream AI agents and AGI.

The AI agent platform race intensifies. The domain name alone signals serious investment, though substance remains to be proven.

## 7. 🛰️ Federal Space Workforce Loses 5,000+ in 2025

More than 322,000 federal employees left government in 2025 — a 13% decline, the largest single-year drop since World War II. Over 5,000 were from the space workforce, including senior NASA and NOAA leaders with decades of institutional knowledge.

For satellite and spectrum research, this brain drain could slow regulatory processes at agencies critical to LEO constellation coordination and space weather monitoring.

## 8. 🔧 Mitchell Hashimoto Ships "Vouch"

The creator of Terraform, Vagrant, and other foundational DevOps tools released **Vouch**, a new open-source project that immediately hit #1 on Hacker News (891 points, 397 comments).

When Hashimoto builds, the infrastructure world pays attention. Worth watching.

## 9. 📱 iPhone 17e Approaches with A19 Chip

Apple's upcoming **iPhone 17e** (the budget/SE replacement) reportedly includes MagSafe and the new A19 processor, bringing flagship-tier silicon to a lower price point.

More on-device AI capability at budget prices means edge computing and mobile ML inference become accessible to a wider market.

## 10. 🍎 Apple's XNU Clutch Scheduler Documented

Apple published detailed documentation on the **Clutch Scheduler** in XNU, the macOS/iOS kernel. The scheduler manages CPU allocation across efficiency and performance cores on Apple Silicon.

Essential reading for anyone optimizing performance-sensitive applications on Apple hardware, from ML inference to real-time audio processing.

## 📊 Today's Takeaway

The biggest story today isn't any single breakthrough — it's the cultural weight AI now carries. Two AI companies dueling in Super Bowl ads, $670B in infrastructure commitments, and fake hardware leaks going viral: we've entered the era where AI is as much a cultural phenomenon as a technical one.

Meanwhile, policy is catching up fast. The EU forcing platform openness and New York proposing data center moratoriums show the regulatory response is accelerating. The infrastructure bottleneck — energy, permits, physical space — may ultimately determine who can build frontier AI and who can't.
