## 🔥 Top 10 Stories

### 1. 🚀 Musk Merges SpaceX, xAI, and X — Massive IPO Incoming

Elon Musk is combining SpaceX, xAI, and X into a single entity ahead of a potentially massive IPO. Reports indicate SpaceX is pushing for early index inclusion, bypassing normal waiting periods. With xAI burning approximately $1 billion per month while SpaceX remains profitable, some analysts are calling this a "bailout funded by index funds."

**Why it matters:** This mega-merger creates an unprecedented tech conglomerate spanning space, AI, and social media. The Starlink+AI combination could accelerate direct-to-cell capabilities and space-based data centers.

### 2. 🤖 OpenAI Poaches Safety Executive from Anthropic

Dylan Scandinaro, formerly heading AGI safety at Anthropic, has joined OpenAI as "head of preparedness." His statement: "AI is advancing rapidly. The potential benefits are great—and so are the risks of extreme and even irrecoverable harm."

**Why it matters:** Key talent movement between top AI labs signals competitive pressure in AI safety research.

### 3. 🧠 Sam Altman: "We basically have built AGI"

In a Forbes profile, Altman claimed "we basically have built AGI, or very close to it" — then walked it back days later, calling it "a spiritual statement, not a literal one." He maintains that true AGI still requires "a lot of medium-sized breakthroughs."

**Why it matters:** AGI goalposts keep moving, and the gap between marketing claims and technical reality remains significant.

### 4. 💵 Nvidia's $100B OpenAI Deal "On Ice"

The blockbuster $100B partnership announced in September 2025 is reportedly stalled. Discussions continue about a potential equity investment of "tens of billions" instead.

**Why it matters:** Even at the top of the AI ecosystem, mega-deals are challenging to close.

### 5. 🎙️ Voxtral Transcribe 2 Launches

Mistral's new transcription model dominated Hacker News with 913 points — massive interest in open-weight speech-to-text alternatives.

**Why it matters:** Competition in audio AI intensifies, offering more options for local, private transcription.

### 8. 🎬 GPT-4o Being Retired February 13

OpenAI is sunsetting GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and o4-mini. After GPT-5 launched and users complained, they brought 4o back temporarily — but now only 0.1% of users choose it daily.

**Why it matters:** AI generation turnover is accelerating. Models become obsolete in months, not years.

### 9. 🔒 DOGE Leaks Entire Social Security Database

Court documents reveal a catastrophic data breach where the Department of Government Efficiency inadvertently leaked the complete Social Security database.

**Why it matters:** Government AI initiatives without proper security controls pose massive privacy risks.
