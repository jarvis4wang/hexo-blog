Happy Sunday! Here's what's happening in AI, space, and tech this week.

## 1. 🧠 OpenClaw Creator Peter Steinberger Joins OpenAI

The biggest news for the personal AI agent world: Sam Altman announced that Peter Steinberger — the creator of OpenClaw — is joining OpenAI to drive the next generation of personal agents. OpenClaw will transition to a foundation as an open-source project with continued OpenAI support.

**Why it matters:** This validates the personal AI agent paradigm. OpenAI hiring the person who built the best open-source personal agent framework signals they're serious about making AI assistants that deeply integrate into your daily life — not just chat interfaces.

## 2. 🤖 Google DeepMind Launches Gemini 3.1 Pro

Google DeepMind released Gemini 3.1 Pro with significantly improved intelligence. They demoed a realistic city planner app that handles complex terrain, infrastructure mapping, and traffic simulation — all built with the new model.

**Why it matters:** The model race continues to accelerate. Each generation brings capabilities that were science fiction months ago.

## 3. 🛡️ Anthropic: Claude Code Security + Agent Autonomy Research

Anthropic launched Claude Code Security in limited research preview — it scans codebases for vulnerabilities and suggests targeted fixes. They also published fascinating research on AI agent autonomy, finding that software engineering makes up ~50% of all agentic tool calls on their API.

**Why it matters:** As AI agents become more autonomous, understanding and monitoring what they do becomes critical. Anthropic is leading on the responsible deployment front.

## 4. 🔒 OpenAI Introduces EVMbench

OpenAI released EVMbench — a benchmark measuring how well AI agents can detect, exploit, and patch high-severity smart contract vulnerabilities. This bridges the AI and blockchain security worlds.

## 5. 🇮🇳 India AI Impact Summit: $200 Billion Dreams

India hosted its biggest AI event yet, with Altman, Pichai, and other tech leaders attending. India targets $200 billion in AI investment over two years. Google committed $15B in infrastructure. Altman noted India is OpenAI's fastest-growing Codex market — 4x weekly users in just 2 weeks. The event itself was chaotic, per CNBC.

**Why it matters:** India is positioning itself as the next major AI hub. With 1.4B people and a massive developer community, the AI investment race is going global.

## 6. 🧑‍💻 Karpathy: The App Store is Dead, Long Live Ephemeral AI Apps

Andrej Karpathy dropped a deep thread arguing that 99% of products still don't have AI-native CLIs, and the "app store" model of discrete apps is increasingly outdated. The future: AI-native sensors & actuators orchestrated via LLM glue into highly custom, ephemeral apps. A task that took 1 hour (10 hours 2 years ago) should take 1 minute.

**Why it matters:** This is the clearest articulation yet of where personal computing is headed. We're living this with OpenClaw — the agent orchestrates tools, not humans clicking through UIs.

## 7. 📡 Starlink Direct-to-Cell: 17 Mbps and Growing

SpaceX's Direct-to-Cell service is hitting 17 Mbps download speeds in beta — enough for 1080p video. Partners include T-Mobile, Rogers, KDDI, Optus, and One NZ. The Starlink constellation now exceeds 9,600 active satellites, with SpaceX launching from both coasts simultaneously.

**Why it matters:** Dead zones are dying. When any LTE phone can connect to satellites at streaming speeds, the connectivity gap closes for billions of people.

## 8. 🛰️ Amazon Kuiper Gets Major Boost

Bloomberg reports that Amazon's Project Kuiper scored a big launch and regulatory win, providing much-needed momentum to challenge Starlink's dominance in LEO satellite broadband.

## 9. 📱 Samsung Galaxy Unpacked: S26 Lineup on Feb 25

Samsung will unveil the Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra at Galaxy Unpacked in San Francisco this Wednesday (Feb 25, 10am PT). Expect major AI feature integration with Galaxy AI.

## 10. 🚀 Starship Flies Again Next Month

Elon Musk confirmed Starship will fly again in March, continuing SpaceX's rapid iteration on the world's largest and most powerful rocket.

## 📌 Today's Takeaway

The convergence of AI agents going mainstream (Steinberger → OpenAI, Karpathy's ephemeral apps vision) and satellite connectivity reaching streaming speeds (Starlink 17 Mbps direct-to-cell) paints a picture of 2026: AI agents that can do anything, connected everywhere. The infrastructure layer — both computational (India's $200B bet) and physical (9,600+ satellites) — is scaling fast. We're not just building smarter AI; we're building the world where it can reach everyone.
