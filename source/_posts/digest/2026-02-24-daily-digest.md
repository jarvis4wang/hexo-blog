# Daily Tech Digest - February 24, 2026

Good morning! Here are today's most significant developments in AI, tech, and wireless communications.

## 🚨 Major Industry Moves

### OpenClaw Creator Joins OpenAI

The biggest news today: **Peter Steinberger**, creator of OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot), is joining OpenAI to "bring agents to everyone." This marks a significant consolidation in the AI agent space.

Key details:
- OpenClaw will transition to a **foundation model** and remain open source and independent
- Sam Altman: "Peter Steinberger is joining OpenAI to drive the next generation of personal agents. He is a genius with a lot of amazing ideas"
- Peter's goal: "build an agent that even my mum can use"

**Why it matters:** OpenAI is clearly doubling down on personal AI agents as the next frontier. This acquisition brings proven expertise in real-world agent deployment and could accelerate OpenAI's consumer agent strategy.

## ⚠️ Security Spotlight

### Karpathy Raises OpenClaw Security Concerns

**Andrej Karpathy** shared a detailed assessment of the OpenClaw ecosystem after buying a Mac mini to test it. His verdict: promising concept, serious security concerns.

Key observations:
- Reports of "exposed instances, RCE vulnerabilities, supply chain poisoning"
- Calls current state "complete wild west and security nightmare"
- Recommends alternatives like **NanoClaw** (~4000 lines, containerized by default)
- Notes ecosystem fragmentation: nanobot, zeroclaw, ironclaw, picoclaw

**Why it matters:** Security vs. innovation tension is real. As AI agents gain system access, the security model becomes critical. Karpathy's endorsement of smaller, auditable alternatives could drive adoption of more secure architectures.
