## 🔥 Top Stories

### 1. Elon Musk Merges SpaceX with xAI (and X)

In a stunning corporate move, Elon Musk has merged SpaceX, xAI, and X (formerly Twitter) into a single mega-company. This creates a vertically integrated empire spanning space infrastructure, AI development, and social media distribution.

**Why it matters:** This consolidation could accelerate AI training with Starlink's satellite network for edge compute, while X provides real-time data streams. For 6G/LEO research, this signals deeper integration between satellite constellations and AI workloads.

## 📊 Today's Takeaway

The SpaceX/xAI merger is the story of the day. When the world's most advanced satellite network merges with an AI company and a global distribution platform, the implications are profound:

1. **LEO + AI compute** is no longer theoretical — it's being built
2. **Vertical integration** in tech is accelerating (data, compute, distribution)
3. **Regulatory scrutiny** will intensify (EU raid on X offices same day)

For 6G research: watch how SpaceX's "AI data center constellation" develops. This could redefine what "edge compute" means when your edge is in orbit.
