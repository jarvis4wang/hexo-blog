## 🤖 OpenAI Launches GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark — 1000+ Tokens/Second

Sam Altman announced **GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark**, a lightweight rapid-inference coding model running on **Cerebras WSE-3** wafer-scale chips. Over 1000 tokens per second. It's designed for rapid prototyping and daily coding productivity rather than the heavy-lift tasks of full GPT-5.3-Codex.

**Why it matters:** The Cerebras partnership signals OpenAI diversifying beyond Nvidia for inference workloads. Speed-optimized models for coding could reshape developer workflows — think real-time pair programming at conversational speed.

## 🧬 GPT-5.2 Derives New Result in Theoretical Physics

OpenAI revealed that **GPT-5.2 derived a novel result in gluon interaction physics** — demonstrating that an interaction many physicists assumed would not occur can actually arise under specific conditions. A preprint is being published with researchers from the Institute for Advanced Study, Vanderbilt, Cambridge, and Harvard.

**Why it matters:** This isn't solving known problems — it's generating *new knowledge*. If AI models can reliably contribute original scientific results, it fundamentally changes the research paradigm. The collaboration with top institutions lends serious credibility.

## 💰 Anthropic Raises $30B at $380B Valuation

Anthropic closed a massive **$30 billion funding round**, more than doubling its valuation to **$380 billion** post-money. The company also appointed Chris Liddell (former Microsoft & GM CFO) to the board and announced a partnership with CodePath to bring Claude to 20,000+ students at community colleges, state schools, and HBCUs.

**Why it matters:** This is the largest AI funding round ever. Anthropic is positioning itself not just as an OpenAI competitor but as a governance-focused alternative. The education push with CodePath could build a generation of Claude-native developers.

## 🏗️ OpenAI's "First Proof" Challenge — AI Tackles Frontier Math

Sam Altman highlighted OpenAI's **"First Proof" challenge**, pushing models to tackle novel frontier math research problems — not just exam questions, but genuinely open mathematical problems. Multiple OpenAI researchers shared excitement about models showing progress on problems that have stumped humans.

**Why it matters:** After the IMO success last summer, skeptics called it "just high school math." This challenge targets *frontier research-level* mathematics — a much harder and more meaningful benchmark for AI capability.

## 🎮 Google DeepMind Launches Project Genie

Google DeepMind released **Project Genie** for Google AI Ultra subscribers — an AI that generates **interactive 3D worlds** from text descriptions. "You dreamed it. Project Genie built it."

**Why it matters:** World-model generation is a key frontier for AI. Interactive 3D environments from text could transform gaming, simulation, training, and virtual prototyping. Google making this consumer-accessible (via AI Ultra) is a bold move.

## 🧠 Karpathy: Full GPT in 243 Lines of Pure Python

Andrej Karpathy released a minimal GPT implementation — **complete training and inference in 243 lines** of dependency-free Python. He describes it as "the full algorithmic content of what is needed. Everything else is just for efficiency. I cannot simplify this any further."

**Why it matters:** Karpathy continues to be the best AI educator alive. Distilling GPT to its pure algorithmic essence makes the technology radically accessible. Great for students, researchers, and anyone wanting to truly understand transformers.

## 🛰️ Starlink Hits 10M Customers, Removes All Waitlists Globally

Starlink announced **10 million+ active customers** across 160 countries and **removed waitlists everywhere** service is available. Also signed deals with Italian high-speed rail (Italo) and Southwest Airlines (300+ aircraft by end of 2026).

**Why it matters for 6G research:** Starlink's scale is now undeniable. Research shows Starlink already outpaces European cellular networks on some metrics. The aviation and rail partnerships show LEO connectivity becoming ubiquitous infrastructure — exactly the non-terrestrial network (NTN) integration that 6G standards are targeting.

## 📡 AST SpaceMobile Unfurls Largest Commercial Antenna in LEO

AST SpaceMobile deployed the **largest commercial communications array antenna** in low Earth orbit, challenging Starlink in the direct-to-cell space. Plans to launch 45-60 next-gen satellites by end of 2026 for US 5G coverage to unmodified smartphones.

**Why it matters for 6G research:** The AST vs Starlink direct-to-cell competition is accelerating the NTN ecosystem. AST's approach (massive phased arrays → 5G-like performance) vs Starlink's approach (massive constellation → coverage) represents two competing architectures that will inform 6G NTN standards.

## 📉 "Software-mageddon" Rocks Wall Street

February 13 saw a massive sell-off dubbed **"Software-mageddon"** as investors fled AI/software stocks for utilities and staples. The market message: AI is coming for software, legal, wealth management, and logistics businesses. The Guardian reports evidence that AI disruption fears are now priced into markets.

**Why it matters:** The "AI-at-any-price" trade is finally meeting gravity. Investors are differentiating between AI infrastructure winners and software companies vulnerable to AI disruption. This could be a healthy correction — or the start of a broader reckoning.

## ⚠️ Grok Gains Market Share Despite Image Controversy

Reuters reports xAI's **Grok gained US market share** even as it faces global censure and regulatory scrutiny over non-consensual sexualized AI-generated images of women and minors. The controversy hasn't dented adoption — if anything, it's driven attention.

**Why it matters:** This highlights the tension between AI safety and market dynamics. When controversy drives engagement, the incentive structures are broken. Expect regulatory action to accelerate.

## 🎯 Today's Takeaway

The Valentine's Day verdict: **AI is in a relationship with physics now** (GPT-5.2 discovering new science), **the money keeps flowing** (Anthropic's record $30B), and **space internet is going mainstream** (Starlink 10M + airlines + trains). Meanwhile, Wall Street is having second thoughts about which software companies survive the AI wave. The gap between "AI infrastructure" and "AI-disrupted" is becoming the defining market divide of 2026.
