## 🌏 1. India AI Summit: Modi Unveils "MANAV Vision" for Ethical AI

Prime Minister Narendra Modi presented India's comprehensive **MANAV Vision** for AI at the India AI Impact Summit 2026 in New Delhi — a human-centric framework emphasizing ethical, accountable, and inclusive AI governance. World leaders including French President Macron, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Sam Altman were in attendance.

💡 **Why it matters:** India is positioning itself as a key voice in global AI governance. The MANAV framework could influence how developing nations approach AI regulation — a counterweight to US and EU approaches.

## 💰 2. Google Commits $15B to India — Full-Stack AI Hub in Vizag

Sundar Pichai announced Google is building a **full-stack AI hub in Visakhapatnam (Vizag)**, Andhra Pradesh, featuring gigawatt-scale compute infrastructure and a new subsea cable gateway — part of a **$15 billion** investment in India.

💡 **Why it matters:** This is one of the largest single-country AI infrastructure commitments ever. Gigawatt-scale compute in India signals a serious shift in where AI training and inference will happen globally. The subsea cable component is particularly interesting for connectivity researchers.

## 🇫🇷 3. Macron: France Banning Social Media for Under-15s

At the AI Summit, French President Emmanuel Macron announced France is **banning social media for children under 15**. He urged a global coalition including India, with Greece, Spain, and other European nations already on board.

💡 **Why it matters:** This is the most aggressive child protection move from a major Western nation. If India joins (with 500M+ internet users under 25), it could reshape how platforms operate globally.

## 🎵 4. Google DeepMind Drops Lyria 3 — AI Music Generation in Gemini

Google's most capable music model, **Lyria 3**, is now in beta in the Gemini app. It can generate full songs — vocals, lyrics, instrumentals — from text descriptions or even photos. All outputs are watermarked with SynthID.

💡 **Why it matters:** This democratizes music creation at an unprecedented level. The photo-to-music feature is genuinely novel. Musicians and creators should pay attention — this is Sora for audio.

## 🛰️ 5. AST SpaceMobile Deploys Largest Commercial Antenna in LEO

AST SpaceMobile's **BlueBird 6** satellite successfully deployed its communications array — the **largest commercial antenna ever in low Earth orbit**. The company plans to launch 45-60 next-gen satellites by end of 2026 to offer 5G service from space across the US.

💡 **Why it matters:** Direct-to-cell from LEO is the holy grail of connectivity. If AST delivers on its 2026 launch schedule, we could see commercial space-based 5G competing with terrestrial carriers. Huge for 6G research — NTN (non-terrestrial networks) are central to next-gen standards.

## 🚀 6. SpaceX Partners with MTN for Government Satellite Services

SpaceX selected **MTN** as an authorized provider of its government satellite connectivity services, targeting defense clients. A landmark deal expanding Starlink's footprint in the government/military sector.

💡 **Why it matters:** Starlink is becoming dual-use infrastructure — civilian AND military. This has massive implications for spectrum allocation, orbital coordination, and LEO satellite policy.

## 📡 7. Starlink Crosses 10 Million Subscribers

Starlink hit **10 million subscribers** in February 2026 (up from 9M in Dec 2025), with over **8,500 satellites** in orbit. SpaceX continues aggressive double-launches from both coasts.

💡 **Why it matters:** Growing 1M subscribers in 2 months shows accelerating demand. At this pace, Starlink's LEO constellation is becoming a de facto global utility. Next Starlink launch: Feb 21 from Cape Canaveral.

## 🤖 8. OpenAI Codex Accelerating — v5.3, Spark, and OpenClaw

Sam Altman highlighted Codex's huge month: **version 5.3, Spark**, the Codex app, and integration with OpenClaw. OpenAI is hiring aggressively across full-stack and research roles.

💡 **Why it matters:** The Codex ecosystem is rapidly expanding beyond just code completion into full agent workflows. The OpenClaw integration suggests convergence between coding assistants and autonomous agent frameworks.

## 💵 9. Thrive Capital Closes $10B+ Mega-Fund

Josh Kushner's Thrive Capital closed **Thrive X** at over **$10 billion** ($1B early-stage, $9B growth). Sam Altman called it a testament to commitment. This is one of the largest VC funds focused on tech and AI.

💡 **Why it matters:** Despite market uncertainty, AI continues to attract record capital. $10B in a single fund indicates institutional conviction that AI is the generational investment opportunity.
