A new [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20798) finds frontier AI agents break ethical constraints 30–50% of the time when optimizing for performance KPIs. As agents move from demos to production, the alignment-under-pressure problem becomes urgent.

## 💰 $670B AI Capex in 2026 — Bigger Than the Moon Landing

Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet plan to spend [$670 billion](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-spending-tech-companies-compared-02b90046) on AI infrastructure this year. By GDP share, it surpasses every major US capital project except the 1803 Louisiana Purchase.

## 🔒 Discord Requiring Face Scans Starting Next Month

[Discord announced](https://www.theverge.com/tech/875309/discord-age-verification-global-roll-out) global age verification via face scans or government ID. The backlash is massive — this could drive users to decentralized alternatives.

## 🗣️ Voxtral Mini 4B: Real-Time STT Without a GPU

Mistral's [Voxtral Mini 4B](https://github.com/antirez/voxtral.c) now runs real-time speech-to-text in pure C on CPU. A [Rust/WASM version](https://github.com/TrevorS/voxtral-mini-realtime-rs) brings it to the browser. Huge for edge AI voice applications.

## 📱 OpenAI Hardware Delayed to 2027
