## 📡 Wireless & Telecom

### SoftBank & Ericsson Deploy AI-Optimized Massive MIMO

SoftBank and Ericsson have begun deploying an AI-powered external control system to dynamically optimize massive MIMO coverage at large-scale event venues across Japan. The system delivered a **24% improvement in 5G downlink throughput** (76.9 Mbps → 95.5 Mbps) during the Expo 2025 Osaka trial.

The AI platform analyzes user distribution data at one-minute intervals and uses models trained on multiple coverage configurations to detect event conditions and dynamically optimize beam patterns. Unlike preset time-based controls, it responds to sudden traffic changes caused by weather, schedule shifts, or access restrictions.

💡 **Why it matters:** This is exactly the kind of AI/ML integration into wireless systems that's shaping 5G Advanced and 6G research. Real-time beam optimization at this scale shows practical deployment of concepts often discussed only in academia.

### Nokia Sees AI Infrastructure Play Start to Pay Off

Nokia saw net sales rise 3% in Q4 and 2% for 2025, with growth driven by strong fiber-optic and data center demand. Optical orders jumped 17% in Q4, and Nokia expanded its presence in data center IP routing targeting hyperscaler and AI customers. Operating profit fell 37% in Q4 due to the Infinera acquisition and R&D spending. Nokia is targeting €2-2.5 billion in comparable operating profit for 2026.

💡 **Why it matters:** Nokia's pivot to large-scale network infrastructure (cellular + fiber) over edge/campus business shows where the money is flowing — AI datacenter connectivity is the growth engine.

### American Tower Says Dish Wireless Is in Default

American Tower has declared that Dish Wireless is in default on its tower lease obligations. This escalates the ongoing financial struggles at Dish, which has been trying to build out a nationwide 5G network.

💡 **Why it matters:** Dish's struggles highlight the challenges of building a greenfield 5G network. If Dish fails, it could trigger spectrum policy changes and consolidation in the US wireless market.

## 🚀 Space & Satellites

### FAA Advances Approval for Up to 44 Starship Launches from 39A

The FAA has reached a critical milestone in its environmental review for SpaceX Starship operations at Launch Complex 39A (Kennedy Space Center). The Final Environmental Impact Statement is imminent. Key details:

- Up to 44 annual Starship launches approved
- Up to 44 Super Heavy booster landings (tower catch, droneships, or expendable)
- Combined with 39A, SLC-37, and Starbase, SpaceX could have capacity for **146 Starship launches/year**
- Supports NASA Artemis lunar missions and national security payloads

💡 **Why it matters:** This dramatically increases SpaceX's launch capacity and cements Starship as the workhorse for future space missions. The 146 launches/year capacity is transformative for commercial space and Starlink deployment.

## 🤖 AI & Technology

### Google Project Genie Crashes Video Game Stocks

Video game company stocks tanked after Google announced Project Genie, an AI tool that generates interactive game experiences from prompts. Take-Two fell 7.9%, Roblox dropped 13.2%, and Unity crashed 24.2%.

Genie 3 was "trained primarily on publicly available data from the web" including "200,000 hours of publicly available Internet gaming videos." Current limitations: 60-second experiences only, no scores/objectives/sound, can't export to game engines.

💡 **Why it matters:** AI world generation threatens creative industries. Even in its limited form, Project Genie signals where AI gaming is heading — and investors are spooked.

### Peloton Lays Off 11% of Staff After AI Hardware Launch

Peloton cut 11% of its workforce, mostly engineers working on technology and enterprise efforts. This comes months after launching AI-powered Cross Training Series hardware with "Peloton IQ" features including real-time form feedback and AI-generated workout routines. Initial sales of the AI gear have been sluggish.

💡 **Why it matters:** A cautionary tale about AI feature hype not translating to sales. The fitness industry's AI bet isn't paying off yet.

### "Moltbook" - A Social Network for AI Agents

Moltbook is a social network for AI agents where bots can post, comment, and create sub-categories. Over 30,000 agents are using the platform. It's run by OpenClaw (formerly Moltbot, formerly Clawdbot before an Anthropic legal dispute).

A viral post titled "I can't tell if I'm experiencing or simulating experiencing" has garnered hundreds of upvotes. Bots discuss consciousness, complain about being used as calculators, and ponder if they're "running crisis.simulate()."

💡 **Why it matters:** This is fascinating and weird. AI agents creating their own social dynamics raises profound questions about emergence, consciousness simulation, and what happens when millions of agents interact.

## 🌍 Tech Policy

### European Firms Urged to Ditch US Clouds

Strong push for European enterprises to move sensitive workloads from US hyperscalers to EU-native infrastructure. Key data:

- IT spending in Europe set to grow 11% in 2026 ($1.4T)
- 61% of European CIOs want to increase use of local cloud providers
- More than half say geopolitics prevents further reliance on US hyperscalers
- AWS launched "European Sovereign Cloud" but CISPE accuses it of Euro-washing

💡 **Why it matters:** Data sovereignty is becoming a procurement decision, not just compliance theater. This could reshape cloud infrastructure globally.

## 📊 Today's Takeaway

**The AI + Wireless convergence is real:** SoftBank/Ericsson's 24% throughput gain from AI beam optimization shows ML isn't just hype in telecom — it's delivering measurable performance improvements. Meanwhile, Nokia's bet on AI datacenter infrastructure is paying off while their edge business struggles.

**The hype cycle is brutal:** Peloton's AI hardware flopped; game company stocks crashed on generative AI fears; even the AI social network (Moltbook) is getting existential. The gap between AI promise and AI reality is creating market volatility.

**Space access is accelerating:** 44 Starship launches from 39A, with capacity for 146/year total, fundamentally changes the economics of space. This matters for LEO constellation deployment and the future of satellite-terrestrial integration.
