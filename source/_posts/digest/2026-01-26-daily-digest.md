### Karpathy's nanochat Miniseries: Scaling Laws Validated

Andrej Karpathy [posted](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2009037707918626874) detailed results from nanochat miniseries v1, reproducing the famous Chinchilla scaling law plots. Key finding: you can train compute-optimal miniseries and relate them to GPT-2/3 via objective CORE scores, all for about **$100** (~4 hours on 8XH100).

**Why it matters:** This is educational gold for understanding LLM training. It shows you can do serious scaling experiments without breaking the bank, democratizing understanding of how frontier models are built.
