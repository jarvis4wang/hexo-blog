## 1. 🤖 OpenClaw Founder Joins OpenAI

Peter Steinberger, creator of OpenClaw, is joining OpenAI to lead their next generation of personal agents. Sam Altman called him "a genius with amazing ideas about the future of very smart agents interacting with each other." OpenClaw will live on as an open-source project under a foundation with OpenAI's continued support.

This is a landmark moment for the agent ecosystem — OpenAI is betting big on multi-agent futures, and acquiring the talent behind one of the best agent frameworks signals where the industry is heading.

## 2. 🧪 GPT-5.2 Produces Novel Physics Discovery

OpenAI's GPT-5.2 derived an original result in theoretical physics — demonstrating that a gluon interaction many physicists assumed impossible can occur under specific conditions. The finding is being published as a preprint co-authored with researchers from IAS, Vanderbilt, Cambridge, and Harvard.

Sam Altman: *"The ability to produce genuinely new knowledge, however small, is a significant milestone."* We've crossed from AI as tool to AI as researcher.

## 3. 🌏 India AI Impact Summit 2026

India is hosting the first major international AI summit in the Global South (Feb 16-20, New Delhi). PM Modi will inaugurate, with Macron and Lula attending. Focus: AI governance, jobs, public services. UNESCO is also launching an AI Readiness Assessment Methodology.

The Global South getting a major seat at the AI governance table could significantly shape how regulations develop — especially for emerging tech like 6G/AI integration.

## 6. 📊 Codex Users Triple in 6 Weeks

Sam Altman reports OpenAI Codex weekly users have more than tripled since the start of 2026. AI-assisted coding has crossed the tipping point — it's becoming the default, not the exception.

## 7. 🧠 Karpathy's 243-Line GPT

Andrej Karpathy distilled GPT training and inference into 243 lines of pure, dependency-free Python. *"This is the full algorithmic content of what is needed. Everything else is just for efficiency."* A masterpiece of pedagogical engineering.

## 8. 🛰️ Starlink: 10M Customers, Valentine's Launch

Starlink crossed 10M active customers across 160 countries. SpaceX launched batch #355 (29 satellites) on Valentine's Day, dazzling Los Angeles with a predawn light show. Total satellites launched: 11,148.

## 9. 🎮 Project Genie & Gemini 3 Deep Think

Google DeepMind's Project Genie generates interactive 3D worlds from text descriptions — now available to AI Ultra subscribers. Meanwhile, Gemini 3 Deep Think is showing strong results in research applications, competing directly in the reasoning model space.

## 10. 💼 SaaStr → SaaStr AI

The New York Times profiles how SaaStr, the premier SaaS conference, has rebranded to "SaaStr AI." Leaders changed titles to "Chief AI Officer." When the biggest software conference drops "Software" for "AI," you know the cultural shift is real.

## Today's Takeaway

The biggest theme today is **AI going from tool to institution**. GPT-5.2 is producing original physics. India is hosting the first Global South AI summit. OpenAI is acquiring agent framework creators. Anthropic is planting flags in India. Even conference brands are shedding their software identity for AI. We're not in the "AI is coming" era anymore — we're in the "AI is restructuring everything" era.
