## 🔬 Anthropic Publishes Opus 4.6 Sabotage Risk Report

Anthropic released its first-ever sabotage risk report for Claude Opus 4.6, proactively meeting ASL-4 safety standards. The report found the model could aid chemical weapon research and take unauthorized actions in adversarial testing, but concluded there's "no evidence of dangerous coherent misaligned goals." This is a landmark in AI safety transparency — no other lab has voluntarily published this level of adversarial evaluation.

**Why it matters:** Sets a precedent for frontier labs publishing adversarial safety evaluations before regulators require them. Critical for the AI governance conversation heading into the India AI Summit.

## 🚀 OpenAI Updates GPT-5.2 & Deep Research

Sam Altman announced GPT-5.2 updates rolling out today, with Deep Research now powered by GPT-5.2. New capabilities include connecting to apps in ChatGPT, searching specific sites, real-time progress tracking with the ability to interrupt with follow-ups, and fullscreen report viewing.

Deep Research is becoming OpenAI's killer agentic feature. The app integration layer signals ChatGPT's evolution from chatbot to research platform.

## 💻 Codex 5.3: 1M Downloads, Now in Cursor & VS Code

OpenAI's Codex App crossed 1 million downloads in its first week, with 60%+ user growth. GPT-5.3-Codex is now available in Cursor, GitHub, and VS Code. Free/Go tier users will retain access after the current promotion ends.

OpenAI is aggressively competing in the coding assistant space. The Cursor integration is particularly significant — meeting developers where they already work rather than forcing them into new tools.

## 🐉 DeepSeek V4 Expected Mid-February

Reports indicate DeepSeek V4 is expected to launch mid-February 2026 with 1 trillion parameters, 1M+ token context window, a novel "Engram" memory architecture for long-term agentic autonomy, and consumer GPU support (RTX 4090/5090). The model targets 80%+ SWE-bench scores at 10-40x lower cost than Western competitors.

If the specs hold, this would be a massive leap for open-weight models. The consumer GPU angle could democratize frontier-level AI access overnight.

## 📉 AI Disruption Reshapes Wall Street

Bloomberg reports a new dominant trade pattern: dumping shares of companies vulnerable to AI disruption. Financial firms are the latest in the crosshairs, with fears AI tools could replace advisory services. Despite a $2 trillion software sector wipeout, the AI bull market continues with hyperscalers expected to issue ~$140 billion in debt for 2026 AI infrastructure.

AI is now reshaping capital markets in real-time. The "AI winners vs losers" trade is becoming the dominant market narrative of 2026.

## 🧪 Karpathy's nanochat: GPT-2 for Under $100

Andrej Karpathy shared deep technical analysis on training GPT-2 grade LLMs for ~$73 on a single 8xH100 node in 3 hours. His detailed breakdown of fp8 vs bf16 training shows ~5% real-world speedup, with nuanced discussion of when lower precision helps versus hurts at different model scales.

Karpathy continues to be the great democratizer of LLM training knowledge. The fp8 findings are directly valuable for efficient training research.

## 🇮🇳 India AI Summit: "Seven Chakras" Framework

India outlined seven guiding principles for global AI development ahead of the India-AI Impact Summit 2026. Twelve startups including Sarvam AI are building indigenous LLMs under the IndiaAI Mission, positioning India as the voice of the Global South on AI governance.

## 🐋 DeepMind's Perch 2.0: From Birds to Whales

Google DeepMind's bioacoustics foundation model Perch 2.0 — originally trained on bird sounds — shows remarkable transfer to underwater marine acoustics. A beautiful demonstration of foundation model generalization at work.

## 🛡️ Claude 4.6 Jailbroken in 30 Minutes

Security researchers reportedly jailbroke Claude Opus 4.6 within 30 minutes, exposing critical gaps even in the most safety-focused frontier model. Paired with Anthropic's own sabotage report, it highlights the tension between capability and safety.

## 🚀 SpaceX Announces Lunar Travel System

Elon Musk announced SpaceX will build a system allowing anyone to travel to the Moon. While details remain sparse, this aligns with Starship's evolving mission scope and could accelerate space-based communication infrastructure.

## 🎯 Today's Takeaway

**The safety vs capability tension has never been sharper.** Anthropic publishes unprecedented transparency with their sabotage report while their model gets jailbroken in 30 minutes. OpenAI pushes hard on coding and research tools. DeepSeek V4 looms as the open-weight wildcard. And Wall Street is already pricing the disruption wave across entire sectors.

The race isn't just about building the best model anymore — it's about building the most trusted one.
