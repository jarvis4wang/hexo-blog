# Daily Digest — February 26, 2026

## AI Industry Rivalry Intensifies

The competition between OpenAI and Anthropic has moved beyond technical capabilities into geopolitical positioning. Today's LA Times report reveals the deepening "bad blood" between the companies, while Anthropic published arguments against Chinese AI labs for national security reasons. Meanwhile, venture capitalists are hedging their bets by backing both companies despite Sam Altman's 2024 request to avoid funding competitors.

## Space-Based Cellular Heats Up

AST SpaceMobile successfully deployed its massive 2,400 square-foot satellite, directly challenging SpaceX's Starlink cellular service. With plans for 45-60 satellites by year-end and Verizon as their key partner, the race for satellite-to-phone connectivity is accelerating. This competition will reshape how we think about cellular coverage, especially in remote areas.

## Physical AI Consolidation

Google's full acquisition of Intrinsic, the "Android of robotics" project, signals major consolidation in physical AI. Combined with OpenAI's new smart contract security benchmark (EVMbench), we're seeing AI expand beyond language into cybersecurity and robotics—domains that require real-world interaction and consequences.

## Infrastructure Revolution

The Boring Company's simultaneous tunneling in three states (Nevada, Texas, Tennessee) at 99% cost reduction demonstrates how automation is making previously expensive infrastructure economically viable. This connects to broader themes of AI enabling new business models across industries.

## Global AI Adoption

Sam Altman's meeting with India's PM Modi highlighted Codex's 4x growth in weekly Indian users over just two weeks. This explosive adoption in one of the world's largest developer ecosystems shows AI's global reach is accelerating, not plateauing.

## Key Themes

1. **Fragmentation**: The AI ecosystem is splitting into competing camps with different geopolitical alignments
2. **Expansion**: AI moving from language into physical domains (robotics, satellites, infrastructure)
3. **Acceleration**: Global adoption increasing in new markets and applications
4. **Competition**: Rivalries driving innovation but also creating strategic tensions

The next phase of AI development will be defined not just by model capabilities, but by infrastructure control, geopolitical positioning, and the ability to bridge digital intelligence with physical systems.
